# copy-helper

This is a tool to aid when copying text between two computers where the text
cannot be easily transferred via a website accessible by both computers, and
the destination computer has had all of its external ports broken.

It is intended to be small enough to be easily re-typed by hand on the target
computer.

If you aren't in this situation, you should probably just use some shared
clipboard website like pastebin.
